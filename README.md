GETTING STARTED
To get started using GatsbyJS, download the Gatsby CLI: npm i -g gatsby. This command-line tool enables you to generate, run, and build a Gatsby application.

To get up and running quickly, you can use the Gatsby default starter repository. After cloning this, run npm install and then gatsby develop. This will generate a fully active Gatsby application running on http://localhost:3000.

To confirm that pages have already been rendered, you can visit any of the pages and click View source. Note, though, that you can also click links and the page will update without a full refresh, as you would expect from a PWA.

To get off the ground, I used the Gatsby starter repository. I forked this from GitHub and renamed the repo. Then I cloned it and used the Gatsby CLI to build. In a very short time, I was up and running on localhost with a live and hot-reloading application.
